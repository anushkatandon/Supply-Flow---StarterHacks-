# StarterHacks: Supply Flow-

Designed a website that allows homeless shelters to update and publish their inventories so that volunteer organizations 
know how to distribute their donations.
  Back end algorithm ranks shelters in terms of priority and produces a distribution ratio.
  Front end web design is simple and user friendly.
